# Interactive Registration Form (Glassmorphism Design)

This project is a visually attractive and highly interactive user registration form. [cite_start]It was developed to fulfill the requirements of the Level 1, Task 2 for the Codveda Front-End Development Internship[cite: 30, 40]. The form features a modern "glassmorphism" design, real-time validation, and an intuitive user experience with animated feedback.



## ‚ú® Key Features

This project successfully implements all the required objectives for the task:

* **Floating Labels:** Modern UI pattern where labels float above the input field on focus for a clean look.
* **Real-Time Validation:** Input fields for name, email, phone, and password are validated as the user types, providing instant feedback without a page reload .
* **Dynamic Error & Success Messages:** Visual cues (icons and colored borders) appear instantly to show if the input is valid or not.
* **Password Strength Meter:** A visual bar that updates in real-time to show the strength of the user's password.
* **Enhanced UX with Focus Events:** The form utilizes focus and blur events to create a smooth and professional user experience.
* **Clean & Professional Styling:** The project features a modern, responsive, and visually appealing design styled from scratch.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the form.
* **CSS3:** For all styling, including the glassmorphism effect, floating labels, animations, and responsive design.
* **JavaScript (ES6):** For all client-side logic, including real-time validation, DOM manipulation, and event handling.
* **Font Awesome:** For scalable vector icons used in the form fields.
* **Google Fonts:** For the 'Poppins' typeface to enhance the design.
